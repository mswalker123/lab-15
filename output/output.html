  Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale,</br>
  A tale of a {{libs.favcolor}} {{libs.transport}}</br>
  That started from this tropic port</br>
  Aboard this tiny {{libs.transport}}.</br>

  The {{libs.name}} was a mighty sailing {{libs.name}} ,</br>
  The {{libs.pet}} brave and sure.</br>
  Five passengers set {{libs.action}} that day</br>
  For a three hour tour, a three hour tour.</br>

  The weather started getting rough,</br>
  The tiny {{libs.favcolor}} {{libs.transport}} was tossed,</br>
  If not for the courage of the {{libs.action}} {{libs.pet}}</br>
  The {{libs.name}} would be lost, the {{libs.name}} would be lost.</br>

  The ship set ground on the shore of this uncharted desert isle</br>
  With Gilligan</br>
  The Skipper too,</br>
  The millionaire and his {{libs.action}} {{libs.pet}},</br>
  The {{libs.color}} {{libs.transport}}</br>
  The {{libs.name}} and Mary Ann,</br>
  Here on Gilligan 's Isle.</br>
